Hello, my nickname is Whineey and I study **Software Systems**. Outside of my studies, I actively engage in **penetration testing, computer networks, and operating systems**. I **LOVE** collecting system flags. It is my **#1** hobby.

- üßë‚Äçüíª My main interests are **computer networks** and **penetration testing**.
- üéì I am a student studying **Software Systems**.
- üéØ My dream is to become a professional **Penetration Tester/Red Teamer**.
- ‚úçÔ∏è This blog documents my journey toward achieving this goal.

## My Experience

### Computer Networks

I have been involved with computer networks since high school, where I studied this field. It was there that my passion for **networking** began. During my studies, I worked with **Cisco Academy**, simulated networks in **Packet Tracer**, and configured real **Cisco devices** (routers and switches).

Throughout my studies, I obtained the **Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching Essentials** certificate, which validates my knowledge of networking protocols, routing, and switching.

### Penetration Testing

After finishing my initial studies, I wanted to apply my networking knowledge in practice, which led me to **cybersecurity**, specifically **penetration testing**. I started working with **Linux**, particularly **Kali Linux**, a distribution designed for security analysis. My experience in penetration testing has helped me refine my skills not only in security but also in **system administration and scripting**.

To develop my practical skills, I joined platforms such as:
- **TryHackMe**
- **HackTheBox**
- **Vulnlab**
- **TCM Security**
- **PortSwigger Academy**

Through these platforms, I have learned fundamental attack techniques and methodologies and applied them in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges. During my journey, I have gained hands-on experience in testing:
- **Active Directory networks**
- **Linux and Windows servers**
- **Endpoint devices**
- **Web applications**

I have also validated my knowledge with certifications:
- **eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)**
- **PJPT (Practical Junior Penetration Tester) ‚Äì TCM Security**
- **PWPA (Practical Web Pentest Associate) ‚Äì TCM Security**

My **mid-term goal** is to obtain the **OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)** certification, which will elevate my penetration testing expertise to the next level.
